<h1> Project </h1>
Everday, million terabytes of data is being transffered over the internet. However, if lossless compression didn't exist, this number would be WAYYYYY higher. Lossless compression is a data compression technique that is able to compress data without losing any data. 
<br> <br>
There are various number of algorithms that are being used everyday to compress different types of data. For this project, our team will be utilizing the <b> Huffman Encoding </b> algorithm to compress text files.
